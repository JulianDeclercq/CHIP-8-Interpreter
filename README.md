# CHIP-8-Interpreter

A chip 8 interpreter written in C++. It uses [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) and [glad](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Loading_Library#glad_.28Multi-Language_GL.2FGLES.2FEGL.2FGLX.2FWGL_Loader-Generator.29) for the rendering.
I wrote this program as a personal exercise to get more familiar with low level programming and a first look into emulator development in general.
